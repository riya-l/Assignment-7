Tax Class Codes of Tax Liens in New York City.

The goal of my project was to show the tax class codes of tax liens in New York City.
I got the data from a database called data.gov, here is the link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tax-lien-sale-lists
I used that link to download the data as a CSV file.
A data collection issue that could have occurred is people lying about certain information for their own tax benefits.
